# Apache config parser 1.0.1 #

### Getting Started ###

To run from this folder:

    npm i
    sudo node bin/index.js [apache_base_path]

Or to install and run:

    npm i
    sudo npm link
    sudo audit-config [apache_base_path]

Note: __ if `apache_base_path` isn't specified, it will default to `/etc/httpd` __

### Contributing ###

I was experimenting a lot with different coding styles when I wrote this
originally, but I don't have time to go through the code and fix it or add
features. Being such, I'm completely open to pull requests of any type.
